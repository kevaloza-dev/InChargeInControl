## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ recommended)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (Local or Atlas instance)

### 1. Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder and configure your variables:
```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
```

Start the backend server:
```bash
# For production
npm start

# For development (with auto-reload)
npm run dev
```

### 2. Database Seeding (Required for Admin)
To create a default admin account and a sample quiz, run the seed script:
```bash
cd backend
node seed.js
```
**Default Admin Credentials:**
- **Email:** `admin@example.com`
- **Password:** `AdminPassword123!`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Forced Password Change**: On the first login, even the admin will be prompted to change their password for security reasons. Once the password is successfully updated, this page will no longer be accessible.

### 3. Password Management
The password update page is restricted to users who are required to change their password (those with the `firstLoginRequired` flag set to `true`). After a successful update, users are automatically redirected to their dashboard and cannot manually return to the reset page.

### 4. Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Start the frontend development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`. Make sure the backend is running on `http://localhost:5000` as the frontend is configured to communicate with this port.
